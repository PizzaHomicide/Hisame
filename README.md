# Hisame (氷雨)

Hisame is a TUI tool to help you manage your AniList.

# Todo

- Make the help screen scrollable when it has too much text
- Use proper fuzzy finding for search query filter
- Make anime list columns more dynamic and reactive to available width.  Allow some to shrink (to a minimum), and assign a priority to them for order to cull when there's not enough space.
- Allow user to specify which columns are shown in the list view
- Common search component to make search/text filtering consistent across the application
- [WINDOWS] MPV closes when the terminal is exited
