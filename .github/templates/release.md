Hisame (氷雨) Alpha Release v{{VERSION}}

This is an alpha release of Hisame, a TUI tool for managing your AniList.

## Installation
Download the appropriate binary for your platform and run it from a terminal.

Note:  Playback requires [MPV](https://mpv.io/) to be installed, and ideally available in your PATH.
On Linux or Mac use your preferred package manager.  On Windows the recommended way to install MPV is using winget, as this will setup the PATH correctly.

If MPV cannot be launched via the PATH, you can specify the full path to the executable in the Hisame config file.
